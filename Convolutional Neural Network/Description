Neural Network Implementation:
• Choose a deep learning framework (use Keras: you can even use PyTorch) and
  implement a neural network for an image classification problem.
• Select an appropriate dataset for your application.
• Design and build your neural network architecture. Experiment with different
  layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent, dense) and activation functions.
• Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
• Train your neural network using appropriate optimization techniques (e.g.,
  stochastic gradient descent, Adam optimizer).

Performance Evaluation:
• Evaluate the performance of your neural network model using suitable metrics
  (e.g., accuracy, loss).
• Discuss the impact of hyperparameters on model performance. Experiment with
  varying hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and analyze their
  effects on training dynamics and final performance.

Model Analysis and Interpretation:
• Analyze the trained model's performance through visualizations (e.g., confusion
  matrix, learning curves).
